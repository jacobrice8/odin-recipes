            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1lb penne pasta</li>
                <li>3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1lb Italian sausage</li>
                <li>1lb baby portobello mushrooms (<em>sliced</em>)</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic (<em>minced</em>)</li>
                <li>1.5 cups heavy cream</li>
                <li>0.5 cup Parmesan cheese (<em>grated</em>)</li>
                <li>1 (8oz) package shredded whole milk mozzarella</li>
                <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How to make it</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil; cook the penne uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and return to the pot.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the sausage in the hot oil until crumbly and no longer pink, about 7 minutes: remove from the skillet, leaving the fat in the pan, and set aside. Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil into the skillet and add the mushrooms and garlic. Cook and stir until the mushrooms have browned and begun to release their liquid, about 5 minutes more. Return the sausage to the skillet and pour in the heavy cream. Season with salt and pepper and return to a simmer, cooking until the sauce begins to thicken, about 5 minutes more. Pour the sauce over the pasta and stir. Stir in 1/2 cup mozzarella and Parmesan. Pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.</li>
                <li>Broil in the preheated oven until the mozzarella cheese is bubbly and golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
